# Styleguide

## General:
Professional yet visually engaging
Sleek, modern dark mode aesthetic

## Structure
Colors and styles predefined in variables at the top of the document for easy editing
Card-based design with consistent padding (p-5) and rounded corners
(rounded-lg)
Multi-column grid layout for desktop, max two columns for mobile
responsiveness
Consistent internal spacing within sections (gap-3 for grid elements,
space-y-3 for lists)
Strategic use of borders to separate content areas
Clear visual hierarchy with section headers consistently positioned
Typography:
Title: Large (text-3xl), bold, with gradient text effect
Section headers: Medium (text-lg), bold, more subtle color than title
Body text: Regular weight, high contrast to background (ideally white or
black)
Citations: Small superscript numbers with corresponding footnotes
Disclaimers & secondary information: Extra small (text-xs), lighter color

## Visual Elements:
Lucide icons enclosed in circular backgrounds to create visual rhythm
Icon placement at consistent positions relative to text
Backdrop blur effect (backdrop-blur-sm) for subtle depth
Semi-transparent backgrounds allowing gradient to show through

## Preferred Colors:
Dependent on topic, subtle shades preferred
Sample project colors (graphic about night flights):
    Primary background: Deep gradient from indigo-900 to purple-900
    creating a sophisticated "night flight" ambiance
    Accent colors: Pink-300/400 and violet-200/300 for highlights and
    important elements
    Text hierarchy: White for headings, violet-100 for body text, violet-
    300/400 for secondary information
    Interactive elements: Subtle opacity changes 40% to 60% on hover
    states
    Border accents: Semi-transparent indigo-600/30 and pink-500/30 for
    section delineation
